# Machine Learning: Handwritten-Digit-Classification-Project

The project focuses on classifying handwritten digits (0-9) using the MNIST dataset, which consists of 70,000 grayscale images of handwritten digits. The dataset is divided into 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images, each of size 28x28 pixels. The goal is to build a machine learning model that can accurately classify these images into their respective digit categories.
